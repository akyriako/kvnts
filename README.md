# kvnts
A Kubernetes custom Controller to watch & forward Kubernetes Events to Grafana Loki with Promtail, push them and their correlated Logs as alerts to Slack

## Description
Refer to this [medium article](https://betterprogramming.pub/kubernetes-observability-part-1-events-logs-integration-with-slack-openai-and-grafana-62068cf43ec) for more analytical information 

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) or [K3S/K3D](https://k3d.io/) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
0. Provide enviroment variables

You are going to need to provide the values of `CLUSTER_NAME`, `LOKI_PUSH_GATEWAY_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` as environment variables (just with source from an .env file if you are running locally) or as a `ConfigMap` if you are installing on a cluster 

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

Fill in samples with the necessary Slack tokens:

```yaml
apiVersion: events.kvnts/v1alpha1
kind: SinksConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: sinksconfig
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: sinksconfig-sample
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: kvnts
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: kvnts
  name: sinksconfig-sample
spec:
  slack:
    botToken: "xoxb-"
    channelID: "C0"
    appLevelToken: "xapp-1-"
    debug: false
  excludedReasons: [ "FailedMount" ]
```

You can completely omit `excludedReasons`, this is just an example of how you could in a declarative way to ignore Kubernetes Events for specific set of `Reasons` 

and then install them in the cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kvnts:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kvnts:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
